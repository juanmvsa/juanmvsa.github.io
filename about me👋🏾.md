I am Juan Vásquez (he/him), a 2nd-year **MsC student in Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence** at the Applied Mathematics and Systems Research Institute (Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas), a research institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México).

My adviser is [Dr. Gemma Bel Enguix](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RXWYz10AAAAJ), and I am currently working on two projects regarding the detection and mitigation of biases in large language models.

My first ongoing project focuses on the detection of LGBTphobia in Mexican Spanish, while the second one aims at implementing [formal semantics](https://eecoppock.info/bootcamp/Invitation_to_formal_semantics-2022Jan18.pdf) into neural language models, in order to see if propositional, predicate and high-order logic can help us create better language models. 

I am very **interested in** D&I in AI, data engineering, design of explainable algorithms, and applied AI for the understanding of social phenomena.

In the past, I have worked on:

- [paraphrase detection in Spanish](https://sites.google.com/view/par-mex/home).
- a [BERT-like model for the classification of TripAdvisor reviews in Spanish in five classes](https://github.com/juanmvsa/Sentiment-Analysis-TripAdvisor-Spanish).
- the implementation of the [LIME algorithm for visualizing how a BERT model fine-tuned on a novel corpus for happiness classification of tweets in Spanish assigns classes to the test samples](https://github.com/juanmvsa/BertClassifierMultilingual).
- classification of [heteronormative language in English](https://github.com/juanmvsa/HeteroCorpus).

In my free time I enjoy playing J-RPGs, watching horror films and reading contemporary latin-american and queer literature.
