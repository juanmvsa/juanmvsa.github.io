I am Juan Vásquez (he/him), a first-year PhD student in CS at CU Boulder Colorado and I am being supervised by [Dr. Maria L. Pacheco](https://mlpacheco.github.io/) and [Dr. Alexis Palmer](https://www.colorado.edu/linguistics/alexis-palmer). Also, I am part of [BLAST](<https://blast-cu.github.io/>), where I am currently working on neurosymbolic approaches that help computational social scientists find patterns in their data.

During my masters, I worked on hate-speech detection in Mexican Spanish and heteronormative language detection under the supervision of [Dr. Gemma Bel Enguix](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RXWYz10AAAAJ) and [Dr. Karla Ramírez Pulido](https://www.fciencias.unam.mx/directorio/34006).

In 2023, I worked as a consultant for the University of Arizona. In particular, I colaborated with [Dr. Javier Osorio](https://www.javierosorio.net) on automatic classification of news articles related to organized crime in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.

In my free time I enjoy playing J-RPGs, watching horror films and reading contemporary latin-american and queer literature.
