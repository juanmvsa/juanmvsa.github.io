I am Juan V√°squez (he/him), a 2nd-year **MsC student in Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence** at the Applied Mathematics and Systems Research Institute (Instituto de Investigaciones en Matem√°ticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas), a research institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico).

I am currently being advised by [Dr. Gemma Bel Enguix](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RXWYz10AAAAJ), and co-advised by [Dr. Karla Ram√≠rez Pulido](https://www.fciencias.unam.mx/directorio/34006), and we are working on the implementation of a formal verification system of a natural language dataset designed for LBGT+Phobia detection in Mexican Spanish. This approach is based on the literature in formal semantics; in particular in the work of  [Coppock et al.](https://eecoppock.info/bootcamp/Invitation_to_formal_semantics-2022Jan18.pdf), and our goal is to test if methods from formal verification could help NLP practitioners imbue their models with semantic information from their corpora.

Also, I am currently a consultant for the University of Arizona. In collaboration with by Dr. [Javier Osorio](https://www.javierosorio.net) and his team, I am implementing and testing the performance of various large language models classification tasks using corpora related to the organised crime in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico.

Next Fall, I will be starting the PhD program in Computer Science at CU Boulder Colorado under the supervision of Dr. [Mar√≠a-Leonor Pacheco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uKhleBwAAAAJ) and Dr. [Alexis Palmer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=NVxAbD8AAAAJ). Furthermore, I will join the Boulder Language and Social Technologies research group ([BLAST](<https://blast-cu.github.io/>)).

I am very **interested in** D&I in AI, data engineering, neuro-symbolic approaches for machine learning, computational sociolinguistics and computational social science.

In the past, I have worked on:

- Classification of heteronormative language in English ([link to the github repository of the project](https://github.com/juanmvsa/HeteroCorpus)).
- Paraphrase detection in Spanish ([link to the github repository of the project](https://sites.google.com/view/par-mex/home)).
- A BERT-like model for the classification of TripAdvisor reviews in Spanish in five classes ([link to the github repository of the project](https://github.com/juanmvsa/Sentiment-Analysis-TripAdvisor-Spanish)).

In my free time I enjoy playing J-RPGs, watching horror films and reading contemporary latin-american and queer literature.
