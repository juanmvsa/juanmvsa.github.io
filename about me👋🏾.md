I am Juan V√°squez (he/him), a 2nd-year **MsC student in Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence** at the Applied Mathematics and Systems Research Institute (Instituto de Investigaciones en Matem√°ticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas), a research institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico).

My adviser is [Dr. Gemma Bel Enguix](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RXWYz10AAAAJ), and I am currently working on two projects regarding large language models:

- My first ongoing project focuses on automatic detection of LGBTphobia in tweets in Mexican Spanish.
- The second project aims at implementing a formal verification system for semantic analysis of a natural language dataset in Spanish. The formal verification is based on [formal semantics](https://eecoppock.info/bootcamp/Invitation_to_formal_semantics-2022Jan18.pdf), and the goal of this project is to test if formal verification could help NLP practitioners imbue their models with semantic information from the texts.

Also, I am currently a consultant for the University of Arizona. In collaboration with by Dr. [Javier Osorio](https://www.javierosorio.net) and his team, I am implementing various neural classifiers aimed at classifying various texts related to organised crime in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

I will be starting my PhD in Fall 2023 at CU Boulder under the supervision of Dr. [Mar√≠a-Leonor Pacheco](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uKhleBwAAAAJ) and Dr. [Alexis Palmer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=NVxAbD8AAAAJ).

I am very **interested in** D&I in AI, data engineering, neuro-symbolic approaches for machine learning, computational sociolinguistics and computational social science.

In the past, I have worked on:

- classification of [heteronormative language in English](https://github.com/juanmvsa/HeteroCorpus).
- [paraphrase detection in Spanish](https://sites.google.com/view/par-mex/home).
- a [BERT-like model for the classification of TripAdvisor reviews in Spanish in five classes](https://github.com/juanmvsa/Sentiment-Analysis-TripAdvisor-Spanish).

In my free time I enjoy playing J-RPGs, watching horror films and reading contemporary latin-american and queer literature.
