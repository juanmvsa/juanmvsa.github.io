I am Juan Vásquez, a 2nd-year MsC student at the Applied Mathematics and Systems Research Institute (Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas), a research institue of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México). My adviser is [Dr. Gemma Bel Enguix](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RXWYz10AAAAJ). I am currently working on applied NLP for the detection and mitigation of gender biases in language models. 

My current projects focus on homophobia detection in Mexican Spanish, and classification of heteronormative language in English. I have written two papers --one for each project-- that will be published soon.

You can find my resume [here](https://github.com/juanmvsa/juanmvsa.github.io/blob/master/cv.pdf).

In my free time, I like reading, watching films, and working out.
