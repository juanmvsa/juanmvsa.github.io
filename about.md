I am Juan Vásquez, a 2nd-year MsC student in Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the Applied Mathematics and Systems Research Institute (Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas), a research institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México).

My adviser is [Dr. Gemma Bel Enguix](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RXWYz10AAAAJ), and I am currently working on two projects regarding the detection and mitigation of biases in large language models. 

My first ongoing project focuses on the detection of LGBTphobia in Mexican Spanish, while the second one aims at classifying heteronormative language in English. I have written two papers --one for each project-- that have already been accepted at two different conferences, and will be published later this year.

I am very interested in D&I in AI, data engineering, design of explainable algorithms, and applied AI for the understanding of social phenomena.

In the past, I have worked on paraphrase detection in Spanish; a BERT-like model for the classification of TripAdvisor reviews in Spanish in five classes; and the implementation of the LIME algorithm for visualizing how a BERT model fine-tuned on a novel corpus for happiness classification of tweets in Spanish assigns classes to the test samples. 

You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kfwbttPgZ-rRHCYFGOMUpYo5Je0VN47v/view?usp=sharing).

In my free time, I like reading, watching films, and working out.
