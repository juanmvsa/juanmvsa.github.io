I am Juan Vásquez, a 2nd-year MsC student at the Applied Mathematics and Systems Research Institute (Instituto de Investigaciones en Matemáticas Aplicadas y en Sistemas), a research institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México).

My adviser is [Dr. Gemma Bel Enguix](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=RXWYz10AAAAJ). 

I am currently working on the detection and mitigation of gender biases in language models. 

My first ongoing project focuses on detection of homophobia in Mexican Spanish, while the second one aims at classifying heteronormative language in English. I have written two papers --one for each project-- that will be published soon.

In the past, I have worked on paraphrase detection in Spanish, a BERT-like model for the classification of TripAdvisor reviews in Spanish in five classes, and the implementation of LIME for analyzing how a BERT classifier generates its predictions on a novel corpus for happiness classification of tweets in Spanish.

You can find my resume [here](https://github.com/juanmvsa/juanmvsa.github.io/blob/master/cv.pdf).

In my free time, I like reading, watching films, and working out.
